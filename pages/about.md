## Who I Am

I'm **anfu**, a penetration tester working in cybersecurity and a computer engineering student with a deep passion for offensive security. My days are split between breaking into systems professionally and solving CTF challenges for fun.

## Why This Blog Exists

Most security content falls into two categories: overly simplified tutorials or academic papers that are hard to follow. I wanted something in between.

This blog aims to:

- **Document real techniques** that work in actual assessments
- **Explain the "why"** behind attacks, not just the "how"
- **Write like a human**, not a corporate security vendor
- **Share practical knowledge** from both professional work and CTF challenges

No marketing fluff. No SEO keyword stuffing. Just technical content written by someone who does this work daily.

I'm always interested in connecting with other security enthusiasts, discussing techniques, or collaborating on projects.
