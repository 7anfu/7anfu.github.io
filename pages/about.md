<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

<div class="about-content">

I'm **anfu**, a cybersecurity enthusiast who loves breaking things to understand how they work.

I spend most of my time playing CTFs, pwning boxes on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe, and diving deep into attack techniques. This blog is where I document what I learn along the way.

## What I Do

- **Pentesting**: Web apps, Active Directory, privilege escalation
- **CTFs**: Competing and solving challenges regularly
- **Research**: Exploring new attack vectors and tools
- **Teaching**: Sharing knowledge through writeups and guides

## Skills

- Web exploitation (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, deserialization)
- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, ROP chains)
- Active Directory attacks (Kerberoasting, DCSync, GPO abuse)
- Network pivoting and lateral movement
- Linux/Windows privilege escalation

## Why This Blog?

Most writeups I read felt either too basic or too academic. I wanted something in between—technical enough to be useful, but written like you're explaining it to a friend over coffee.

No corporate jargon. No SEO fluff. Just real techniques that actually work.
